  contentInfoData:
  - StepTitle: Definition of Rust
    ContentTitle: What is Rust?
    ContentDescription: Rust is the reddish-brown flaky coating that forms on iron
      and steel when exposed to oxygen and moisture.
  - StepTitle: Oxidation Reaction
    ContentTitle: The Chemistry Behind Rust
    ContentDescription: Rusting occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and water to
      form iron oxide.
  - StepTitle: Rust Formation Conditions
    ContentTitle: Conditions Needed
    ContentDescription: Rust forms when moisture, oxygen, and electrolytes (like
      salt) are present, accelerating corrosion.
  - StepTitle: Forms of Iron Oxide
    ContentTitle: Types of Rust
    ContentDescription: Rust can appear in different forms; red rust, yellow rust,
      brown rust, and black rust depending on environmental conditions.
  - StepTitle: Structural Weakness
    ContentTitle: Why Rust is a Problem
    ContentDescription: Rust weakens metal structures, reducing strength, durability,
      and potentially causing failure over time.
  - StepTitle: Protection Methods
    ContentTitle: Preventing Rust
    ContentDescription: Rust can be prevented through coatings (paint, oil), galvanization
      (zinc coating), or using stainless steel alloys.
  - StepTitle: Inspection Techniques
    ContentTitle: Detecting Rust
    ContentDescription: Early detection uses visual inspections, ultrasonic testing,
      or sensors to identify corrosion before severe damage occurs.
